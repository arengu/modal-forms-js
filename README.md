# Arengu Modal Forms
Tiny modal library to easily embed our forms into your website. This library requires [Arengu Forms JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/arengu/forms-js-sdk) to be loaded first.

## Getting started
To get started, paste this snippets into the `head` tag of your website:

```html
<script async src="https://sdk.arengu.com/forms.js"></script>
<script async src="https://sdk.arengu.com/modal.js"></script>
```

This snippets will load our JavaScript SDK and our tiny modal library into your website asynchronously, so it wonâ€™t affect your website load speed.

Trigger your modal form using any of the following techniques:

### **Method 1: Add a HTML attribute** (Recommended)
Place the following attribute where you want to add a click listener to trigger your modal:

```html
<button data-arengu-modal-form-id="YOUR_FORM_ID">Trigger modal</button>
```

You have to replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your **Form ID**, which you can find in your form settings or share page.

You can place **multiple HTML attributes** on the same page, our modal library will detect all tags with `data-arengu-modal-form-id` attribute and attach a click listener.

### **Method 2:** Calling our `show` method

Our modal library has a show method that allows to trigger your modal form on the website.

`show` method example:
```javascript
ArenguModal.show('5073697614331904');
```
The `show` call has the following fields:

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| formId _(required)_| [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) | The **Form ID** of your form. You can find it in your form settings or share page. |

You can also close the modal form using the `hide` method, this method doesn't require to pass a form ID as our modal flow uses the same tag.

```javascript
ArenguModal.hide();
```
